# Student-Performance-Analysis

## Motivation
***
In the Data Science domain after having the basis knowledge from end to end, a beginner is generally facing a lot of issue while putting all things together.

So, it is going to be great starting reference point for a beginner who wants to getting started with some basic end to end models.

We will follow the below mentioned path 

Objective
Loading and understanding the dataset. 
Exploratory Analysis of Data and Visualization.
Model Building.
We will keep it as simple as possible by putting ourselves in the shoes of a beginner.


## Objective and Data Set
***
In this getting started project, we will Analyze Student Performance based on few parameters such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type and whether the student prepare for test or not.

For this Purpose we are going to use StudentsPerformance.csv file , If you are interested (highly recommended) to follow along you can download the data file from here and go along.

In this Student-Performance-Analysis Project we will analyze the different parameters as mentioned above and their impact on the student performance, we will also create visualization for the same.
After the Analysis is done we will try to make some simple models with the available features and evaluate the performance of our Model.
So, Let's Started !!!
